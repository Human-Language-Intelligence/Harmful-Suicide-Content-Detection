# Harmful Suicide Content Detection

## Overview
This repo provides implementation of Harmful Suicide Content Detection.

## Obtaining the benchmark
The Harmful Suicide Content Detection benchmark contains only publicly available web user posts (e.g., Twitter, Korean Reddit (DCInside), etc). Posts may contain information related to users' mental health, however, and are thus sensitive. To protect users' privacy, researchers who wish to obtain the dataset must sign a data usage agreement.
Succinctly, the agreement requires that researchers
* make no attempt to contact any user in the dataset
* make no attempt to deanonymize or learn the identity of any user in the dataset
* make no attempt to link users in the dataset with any external information (e.g., an account on another website)
* do not share any portion of the data, including example posts or excerpts from posts, with any other party

Researchers interested in obtaining the Harmful Suicide Content Detection benchmark may submit **a data request form to be provided with the data usage agreement [google form link]** with **IRB document**.
