# Harmful Suicide Content Detection Benchmark

## Overview
This repo provides source code, dataset explanations and instructions on how to apply for the Harmful Suicide Content Detection Benchmark (through data usage agreement).

## Abstract
Harmful suicide content on the Internet is a significant risk factor inducing suicidal thoughts and behaviors among vulnerable populations.
Despite global efforts, existing resources are insufficient, specifically in high-risk regions like the Republic of Korea. Current research mainly focuses on understanding negative effects of such content or suicide risk in individuals, rather than on automatically detecting the harmfulness of content.
To fill this gap, we introduce a harmful suicide content detection task for classifying online suicide content into five harmfulness levels.
We develop a multi-modal harmful suicide content detection benchmark and a task description document in collaboration with medical professionals, and leverage large language models (LLMs) to explore efficient methods for moderating such content. Our contributions include proposing a novel detection task, a multi-modal Korean benchmark with expert annotations, and suggesting strategies using LLMs to detect illegal and harmful content.
Owing to the potential harm involved, we publicize our implementations and benchmark, incorporating an ethical verification process.

## Data Usage Agreements
The Harmful Suicide Content Detection benchmark contains only publicly available web user posts (e.g., Twitter, Korean Reddit (DCInside), etc). Posts may contain information related to users' mental health, however, and are thus sensitive. To protect users' privacy, researchers who wish to obtain the dataset must sign a data usage agreement.
Succinctly, the agreement requires that researchers
* make no attempt to contact any user in the dataset
* make no attempt to deanonymize or learn the identity of any user in the dataset
* make no attempt to link users in the dataset with any external information (e.g., an account on another website)
* do not share any portion of the data, including example posts or excerpts from posts, with any other party

Researchers interested in obtaining the Harmful Suicide Content Detection benchmark may submit a data request form to be provided with the data usage agreement and further information (IRB) to [google form link].
